# Agent State

Current work and blockers only. Rules live in `docs/ProjectConstitution.md` and
`.agents/repo-guidance.md`, decisions in `.agents/decisions.md`, and machine observations in
`.agents/machines.md`. Each plan owns its implementation and manual acceptance checklist.
Superseded descriptions are verbatim in `docs/history/state-archive.md` (Archived 2026-09-15).

## Now

- **CloudPasswordReset: the owner is populating `employeeID` on Entra CLD accounts (2026-09-15).**
  This replaces heuristic name/alias matching with a direct key: the CLD account's `employeeID`
  matches the AD employee record's employee identifier, and that record supplies the destination
  mailbox. The owner directs reopening module work on this basis. The name/alias/legacy-suffix
  rules proposed in `.agents/research/cloud-password-owner-runtime.md` are consequently candidates
  for demotion to fallback or deletion, and the 89/82 split from the old experiment is superseded
  as a coverage claim once enrollment completes. Open: enrollment is in progress, not complete, so
  the resolver's behavior for an unpopulated `employeeID` (refuse vs fall back) is undecided, as is
  whether `employeeID` alone is sufficient without a corroborating name check. Implementation
  remains on hold pending an updated plan.

- **CloudPasswordReset: runtime owner investigation reopened; implementation remains on hold.**
  The owner requested completion of the runtime-association investigation and authorized the
  M365Connections/PTK connection. Scope is individually owned employee CLD accounts. L2 alone
  uses the app; ServiceNow and the employee do not interact with it. No advance enrollment,
  maintained owner map, or operator-supplied delivery address. Requirements are recorded in
  `.agents/decisions.md` (2026-09-14); current evidence, proposed rules and remaining validation
  are canonical in `.agents/research/cloud-password-owner-runtime.md`. Inspect the local
  diagnostic receipt listed in `.agents/machines.md`, independently classify unresolved
  employee candidates, then approve an updated plan before implementation. The old held
  `docs/CloudPasswordReset-Plan.md` still describes operator-entered delivery and is not the
  current proposed solution. No module code or new permissions have shipped. The abandoned
  tooling remains deleted; its earlier survey approval is not standing query authority.
  D4 remains unresolved. Survey-data disposition and unnecessary survey-registration grants
  remain open outside module implementation; see Blockers and `.agents/machines.md`.

- **Service Health is implemented; design acceptance and manual checks remain.**
  `docs/ServiceHealth-Plan.md` owns the design and checklist. The original dashboard appearance
  is binding: no redesign, charts or gradients; incident HTML must pass through the sanitizer.
  Enablement, Graph secret ID and section access are now set; secret validity and live Graph
  authentication were not checked. Implementation codereview remains outstanding and needs a go.

- **Shared config cutover is reflected in both deployed appsettings files.**
  `docs/SharedConfigDb-Plan.md` is Implemented and its implementation codereview is closed.
  Do not repeat the one-time cutover based on the old state. Section 8 manual checks (startup
  logs and cross-instance refresh) remain unrecorded. Section 9's decision-wording and
  Constitution flags remain open. Jobs and usage stores stay per instance.

- **Usage telemetry and the save-then-prompt fix are landed.**
  `docs/UsageTelemetry-Plan.md` owns the telemetry implementation and acceptance checklist;
  `.agents/review/findings/utei-{1,2,3,4}.md` own the closed findings. The forced-reload fix is
  guarded by `AdminPageDirtyStateTests.ClearingDirtyStateIsRenderedBeforeAForcedReload`.
  Nothing is queued code-side. Run telemetry's manual checks and confirm saving module
  enablement no longer asks to discard already-saved changes.

- **Group bulk actions and cross-domain fixes are landed; live writes remain unverified.**
  `docs/GroupBulkActions-Plan.md` owns the checklist. Validate remove/re-add and bulk operations
  on a throwaway group: the original admin group is protected and cannot serve as the repro.
  Self-service's home-domain users-only add scope remains intentional. D1 used its drafted
  default (one batch administrator email, per-member audit and affected-user notices);
  the owner may overrule it. Implementation codereview remains outstanding and needs a go.

- **Intune Devices and Risky Users are implemented; remaining manual checks stay live.**
  `docs/IntuneDeviceManagement-Plan.md` and `docs/RiskyUsersModule-Plan.md` own scope and checks.
  Both registrations were proven live in owner validation recorded 2026-09-02; shared-store
  configuration remains present in the dated machine receipt. The owner confirmed Intune
  search on dev 2026-09-03 after `acfabe9`, superseding the earlier combined-filter uncertainty.
  Intune notification/Entra removal are act-time choices, not Module Config defaults.
  Risky Users reads audit without alert emails. Its direct ServiceNow validation, instead of
  the newer per-module seam, remains an unscheduled judgment call, not an admitted defect.

- **The remaining implemented queue awaits manual acceptance only. Do not restart it.**
  Checklists: `docs/BooleanConfigControls-Plan.md`, `docs/BitLockerMandatoryTicket-Plan.md`,
  `docs/ModuleCsvExport-Plan.md`, and `docs/EventLogCsvTicket-Plan.md`. The sidebar Home link
  removal (`2128610`) also needs a visual check; the brand link stays. BitLocker CSV includes
  keys under the owner's ruling, with ticketed disclosure audit and no keys in audit logs.

- **Nesting and protected group targets are implemented; remaining checks stay live.**
  `docs/GroupMemberNesting-Plan.md` and `docs/ProtectedGroupWriteTarget-Plan.md` own the lists.
  Cross-domain member listing was confirmed in both group modules on dev 2026-08-31;
  nested add/remove, cross-domain picker behavior and admin refusal still need applicable
  checks. Self-service is exempt from Protected Group Targets by the 2026-08-31 ruling;
  member protection stays. Review loops are closed; pgwt-3 remains declined at intake
  (`.agents/review/pgwt-3.contested.md`).

## Next

- **Owner-reported issues, raised 2026-09-15; none implemented.**
  1. *Licensing Updates sits in the wrong nav category.* `Modules/ModuleCatalog.cs` gives it
     `Category = "Exchange"`; it writes `extensionAttribute11` in AD and is not an
     ExchangeOnline dependent, so it belongs under `Identity & Access`. Category is nav
     grouping only - section-access keys are per-module policy aliases, so the move does not
     touch authorization. Quickest of the three.
  2. *Service Health misses `status.cloud.microsoft`.* Microsoft splits its status reporting;
     the module currently reads only the Graph service-health source. Needs a decision on how
     that second source is obtained (no documented Graph equivalent is established) before any
     design. Interacts with `docs/ServiceHealth-Plan.md`, whose appearance is binding.
  3. *Mailbox Migrations shows a stale open report.* With a migration report open on the
     module's status page, deleting and recreating the batch under the same name elsewhere
     (another session or PowerShell) leaves the refreshed page showing the previous
     migration's report until the operator closes and reopens it. Suspected identity-by-name
     caching in the open-report state; not yet diagnosed. Reproduction and root cause
     unestablished.

- **Manual validation is outstanding operational work.** Start with
  `docs/DevValidation-2.3.34.md`: Admin Settings access, protected-user alias refusal and the
  reported MailboxPermissions friction are high-consequence unverified behavior. It owns older
  streams' checks; newer plans above own their own. Both instances address live production
  AD/Exchange, so manual writes still need authority for their named scope.
- **Coverage follow-up:** the 2026-08-14 ruling supersedes the standalone "one of three files
  done" task. `ProtectedPrincipalService` work was folded into the now-landed queued plans;
  re-measure on green CI and ratchet per `.agents/review/coverage-floor.txt`.
  `PermissionValidator` still needs its own approved plan for the credential-carrying I/O seam.
  Old percentages are dropped; the floor file owns the measured baseline.
- **Owner-deferred validation stays deferred:** Bulk Job Runner live UI and writes,
  ConferenceRooms protection, GM-3 self-service groups, and servicer override end-to-end proof,
  inverse denial and per-target batch notes. Sources: `docs/BulkJobRunner-Plan.md`,
  `docs/ConferenceRoomsFinderProtectedPrincipalGate-Plan.md`,
  `docs/SelfServiceGroupManagement-Plan.md`, and the archived 2026-08-11 servicer record.
  The owner accepted waiting for real production servicer use; do not re-queue it as urgent.
- **Module packaging/import stays deferred** (owner 2026-07-22, `.agents/decisions.md`).
  **AccountLockoutRemediation and its notification question stay parked** with the disabled
  module; disablement is re-verified in `.agents/machines.md`. No resumption authorized.

## Blockers

- **Falsified deployment/configuration blockers, checked 2026-09-14 as of `a16c316`:**
  the old dev/prod versions, incomplete shared cutover and missing initial ServiceHealth,
  RiskyUsers and IntuneDevices configuration disagree with the host. Evidence is canonical in
  `.agents/machines.md`. Manual acceptance and exact deployed module versions remain unverified.
- **SQLite upgrade is no longer blocked by package availability.** The 2026-06-26 decision's
  "no patched package exists" basis is falsified, checked 2026-09-14 as of `a16c316`:
  local restore still resolves `SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3/2.1.11`, while
  [NuGet publishes newer builds](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SQLitePCLRaw.lib.e_sqlite3),
  including 3.53.3 (the package version identifies its SQLite engine).
  The [advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2m69-gcr7-jv3q) still lists affected versions
  through 2.1.11 and its patched-version field says None. Compatibility is not established.
  Next action: plan and verify a supported update; do not suppress NU1903.
- **CloudPasswordReset residuals:** owner disposition of remaining survey export(s); current
  inventory differs from the old three-file claim (machine receipt). Survey registration
  `16866221-3e2b-4ea5-8aae-157b043b6d7c` was recorded as holding unnecessary
  `Directory.ReadWrite.All`, `User.ReadWrite.All`, `Group.ReadWrite.All` and
  `UserAuthenticationMethod.ReadWrite.All` grants. Consent was not re-queried under the hold;
  revocation needs separate authority.
- **Unsettled guidance conflicts:** the 2026-09-01 owner ruling in the archived queue permits
  one session for all slices with coding subagents; `.agents/repo-guidance.md` Token Budget
  and the 2026-08-27 decision still require a fresh Fable session per slice. Also, the 2026-07-31
  protected-principal input-validation rationale relies on this deployment's read visibility,
  while the 2026-09-11 rule rejects environmental safety assumptions. No contested rule changed;
  owner reconciliation is required.
- **SharedConfigDb record flags:** the decision says SQLite `data_version` / next read;
  implementation uses the store's change token with a throttle. The additive-only rule has
  operative homes in the decision, guidance and test but is absent from the Constitution.
  Evidence: `docs/SharedConfigDb-Plan.md` section 9. No ruling inferred.
- **Plan-status drift remains:** `docs/BlockedSendersLoadTiming-Plan.md` and
  `docs/Comms10kReplaceUx-Plan.md` still say Approved;
  `docs/ConferenceRooms-OnPremRoomListAdd-Plan.md` says Approved / In progress as of `a16c316`.
  Implementation was recorded but full completion is unverified. Do not silently relabel them.
  `docs/AdminUIRedesign-Plan.md` remains In progress with manual checks.
- **Unscheduled M365 protection gap:** group update/delete and owner adds were recorded as
  ungated, and protection configuration cannot identify a cloud-only group. Update/delete
  still lack a check in `Services/M365GroupManagementService.cs` as of `a16c316`.
  The owner excluded this module from the on-prem target work; no work approved.
- **Older questions:** `docs/MessageTraceNullRow-Plan.md` needs a live rerun; the upstream
  null-row cause remains undiagnosed (OQ-1). `docs/ProtectedPrincipalResolution-Plan.md`
  retains OQ-2 on whether the reported cloud-only mailbox targets should remain reachable.
  Alias-protection and MailboxPermissions fixes are not field-validated by deployment alone.
- **Ops gaps:** ConferenceRooms AD secret configuration on prod was previously outstanding
  and was not checked here. `deploy.ps1` still lacks native `-PlanOnly`; the pipeline dry-run
  is the recorded workaround. Reviewer sandbox capability was not re-probed; use dated
  machine notes, not superseded CLI-version assumptions.

## Verification

Commands and mandatory guards are owned by `.agents/repo-guidance.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
This records-only drift sweep requires `git diff --check`; build, tests, browser acceptance,
AD/Graph queries and reviewer dispatches were not run. Current CI status/test counts do not
belong here. Per-finding status is owned by `.agents/review/index.md`.

## Active sources

- `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/repo-guidance.md`, and `docs/ProjectConstitution.md` govern work.
- `.agents/decisions.md` owns decisions; `.agents/machines.md` owns host facts.
- Referenced plans own scope, status and acceptance checklists.
- `Modules/ModuleCatalog.cs` owns module versions and enumeration;
  `ExchangeAdminWeb.csproj` owns the current base app version.
